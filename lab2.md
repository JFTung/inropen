### Four Criteria for Free Software
1.  The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
2.  The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your
computing as you wish.  Access to the source code is a precondition to this.
3.  The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
4.  The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.  By
doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your
changes.  Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

### Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
A license is necessary to outline how you allow your project to be used.  If
you don't have a license, you haven't legally defined the ways that you want
people to use your project.  It's very important, for you and for others, to
have an explicit definition of what you allow people to do with your code.

### Why SHOULDN'T you use a project that doesn't have an explicit licence?
If a project doesn't have an explicit licence, it is by default protected by
copyright (All Rights Reserved).  Therefore, you are not allowed to use the
project's code unless their license explicitly gives you permission.

### Do you agree with the article "Why the Web beat Gopher?"
I agree with the fundamental idea that this article follows.  By releasing your
software to the public, you allow a much larger development community to work
on and improve your code.  As the old saying goes, two heads are better than
one, and a huge development community is better than a smaller development
team.  This is one of the greatest strenghts of open source software.
